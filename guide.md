## Gear Progression {#gear-progression}

For newer players the gear progression can be fairly daunting. We hope to help our members understand the gear in the game with this guide. This guide is maintained by guild officers.

### First character, tell me what to do. {#first-character}

If you've just started - __TAKE YOUR TIME!!!__ There is so much to the game. It takes time to digest the different components. The story will give you the gear you need to keep progressing. Just keep exploring lifeskilling, knowledge gathering, horse training, the worker empire, and get familiar with the different aspects. You can ignore individual aspects or can choose to take them all on.

If you've not just started and need some discrete direction take this route: 

 1. PEN Naru gear
    - If you've not got enough beginner blackstones, keep following along in the story. You get plenty. If you're unsure about enhancing your Naru gear, let me reassure you that you'll be fine by spamming enhance on your Naru gear and not considering failstacks.
 2. Trade in PEN Naru gear for Narchillan gear
    - If you're level 56+ or completed the Calphean Main questline and 50+ you can trade in your PEN Naru gear for Narchillan. You can only do this once per family.
    - Since Narchillan gear can only be acquired once, instead upgrade to Oasis gear at level 56+ if available.
 3. Upgrade to TRI accessories. (If you've been rewarded with Capotia accessories, skip this and use those.)
    1. Start with TRI Red Coral Earrings
        - Why? The price is nice and the accuracy will be helpful against the Drieghan, Kamasylve, and O'Dyllita enemies.
    2. Move to TRI Kagtum Submission Ring
        - Why? Cash of course. This will supplement your AP nicely and give you 2x +4 AP against monsters as well.
    3. TRI Seraps's Necklace
        - Why? Is the price right or is the price right? 
    - If you're strapped for silver, enhance your Red Sand Crystal Rings from the Vallencia questline and Forest's Eye Earrings, a decent alternative to Red Coral Earrings even if you do have the cash, from the Kamasylve questline for the time being.
 4. Boss Gear upgeades
    - Succession: Upgrade to TET Kzarka mainhand
    -  Awakening: Upgrade to TET Dandelion awakening
