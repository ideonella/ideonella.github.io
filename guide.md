# h1 PvP

Our guild is a PvX guild, which means we also have members that like going ham in PvP. While most PvP doesn't require much direction, we have a more dedicated branch
that trains as a unit and has their sights set on casual Node Wars!
These members are part of our structured Enlisted system.

# h2 Terms

Later rules use these terms

* Structured battle – Any battle led by the lieutenant or commander during war-time.
* Enlisted – Members who wish to participate in structured battle.
* Militia – Members who are not enlisted but get caught in structured battle.
* Skirmish – Any battle not involving the lieutenant or commander or any battle not during war-time.

# h2 Rules and responsibilities

Militia may not be punished for breaking PvP duties unless they refuse to retreat when ordered by commander during wartime.
