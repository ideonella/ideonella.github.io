# Socialization {#socialization}

A potential guild member:

A big part of the guild is having guildmates to interact with! Between special events, guild missions, or ad-hoc parties, there's almost always a group of us doing something together. The easiest way to socialize is through Discord. Having a microphone on in Discord is completely optional though, so don't worry about pressure to be active in voice. Feel free to just listen and respond in guild/party chat!

Our guild has some fairly diverse members, so remember to respect everyone! Review the [rules and punishments for breaking them](#/rules) if you feel like being prejudice against peoples. Keeping all communication respectful is a critical part of the guild.

## Servers {#servers}

Having a server list helps us to congregate and notice eachother in the world. Sticking to the server list isn't mandatory, but you'll see more guildmates in the suggested servers.

## Schedule of Events {#schedule-of-events}

We are a casual guild, and while no event is mandatory, we do encourage everyone to attend the events they feel that they would enjoy. Showing up to an event never obligates participation. Coming to the PvP tournaments just to watch gives our PvPers an audience to show off to! Coming to grinds just to PvP others out of the spot is appreciated by the PvE members just trying to farm!

### Ship to Vell {#ship-to-vell}

Every **Wednesday** and **Sunday** we meet up on the **Velia** docks and make a platoon. We make conversation and have a leisurely sail up to Vell. Then, we frantically dive down and swim back up avoiding Vell's insta-kill abilities! This boss has a rare chance to drop Vell's heart. The item sells for around 12 billion silver!

We must leave on the half hour sharp in order to make it on time!

### PvP Tournaments {#pvp-tournaments}

Some of our members are passionate about PvP. This lets us have fun tournament events! There are two kinds of tournaments. Ranked and unranked. Power, or ranked, tournaments happen on the first **Sunday** of the month after Vell and are used to determine P-Rank. Power tournaments use the member's own characters and gear. Enlisted's P-Rank will be published, but publishing is optional for regular members. Unranked tournaments happen every Sunday after Vell. Unranked tournaments can take on several forms: Oasis, where everyone must use Oasis event armor, weapons, and cannot use accessories; Trial, where everyone uses a trial character for the tournament; and Node, where everyone must limit their AP/DP to a certain amount.

This is a great spectator event!

### Mirumok Grinding {#mirumok-grinding}

After Vell on **Wednesdays**, we form groups and go farm Mirumoks! Mirumoks give some of the best Combat EXP in the game, and it's a good way to get some extra money.

---

### Guild Voting {#guild-voting}

On **Fridays** we open voting for guild skills. These skills are unlocked with points earned by guild missions. So if you really want a skill, make sure you participate in the guild missions. The votes are counted Sunday night. Voting for more than one skill is allowed.
 
The Stawpoll will be posted in Discord on Friday evening.
