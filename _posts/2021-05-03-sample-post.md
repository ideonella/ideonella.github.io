Your Title and Description will automatically be posted here. Sections should be included if the article will be longer than one page: three subsections or two phat subsections.

## Sections {#sections}

- [Test 0](#test-0)
- [Test 1](#test-1)

## Test 0 {#test-0}

This is the testPost0's Test 0. These are some fancy styles `A chat command would go in here.` and *slanted* and also **bold**.

``lots
of
chat commands
go here.``

links look like [this](https://magicgirls.us) or you can link another section, like to go back to the [sections](#sections).

A RED banner looks like this.
{: .critical}

Only use the red banner when something BAD will happen if the banner isn't read. Losing money, not being able to do something, or visiting a really hard area are all good red banner uses.

A GOLD banner looks like this.
{: .alert}

Use the gold banner when time will be wasted, or when there's a special note.

## Test 1 {#test-1}

This is a table.

|Column Header|Second|
|-------------|------|
|test|test1|
|aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa|aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa|
|a|a|
