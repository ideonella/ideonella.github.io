### Test 0 {#testpost0-test-0}

This is the testPost0's Test 0. These are some fancy styles `A chat command would go in here.` and *slanted* and also **bold**.

``lots
of
chat commands
go here.``

links look like [this](https://magicgirls.us) or you can link another section, like to go back to the [sections](#testpost0-sections).

A RED banner looks like this.

Only use the red banner when something BAD will happen if the banner isn't read. Losing money, not being able to do something, or visiting a really hard area are all good red banner uses.

A GOLD banner looks like this.

Use the gold banner when time will be wasted, or when there's a special note.

### Test 1 {#testpost0-test-1}

This is a table.
