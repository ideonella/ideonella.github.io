<h1>PvP</h1>
<p>Our guild is a PvX guild, which means we also have members that like going ham in PvP. While most PvP doesn't require much direction, we have a more dedicated branch
that trains as a unit and has their sights set on casual Node Wars!</p>
<p>These members are part of our structured Enlisted system.</p>

<h2>Terms</h2>
<p>Later rules use these terms.</p>
<ul>
<li>Structured battle – Any battle led by the lieutenant or commander during war-time.</li>
<li>Enlisted – Members who wish to participate in structured battle.</li>
<li>Militia – Members who are not enlisted but get caught in structured battle.</li>
<li>Skirmish – Any battle not involving the lieutenant or commander or any battle not during war-time.</li>
