# PvP {#pvp}

Our guild is a PvX guild, which means we also have members that like going ham in PvP. While most PvP doesn't require much direction, we have a more dedicated branch
that trains as a unit and has their sights set on casual Node Wars!

These members are part of our structured Enlisted system.
