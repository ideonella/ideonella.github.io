<h1>Socialization</h1>
<p>A big part of the guild is having guildmates to interact with! Between special events,
 guild missions, or ad-hoc parties, there's almost always a group of us doing something together.
 The easiest way to socialize is through Discord.
 Having a microphone on in Discord is completely optional though, so don't worry about pressure to be active in voice.
 Feel free to just listen and respond in guild/party chat!</p>

<p>Our guild has some fairly diverse members, so remember to respect everyone! Review the <a href="/#rules">rules and punishments for breaking them</a>
 if you feel like being prejudice against peoples. Keeping all communication respectful is a critical part of the guild.</p>

<h2>Servers</h2>
<p>Having a server list helps us to congregate and notice eachother in the world. Sticking to the server list isn't mandatory, but you'll see far fewer guildmates in other servers.</p>

<h2>Schedule of Events</h2>
<p>We are a casual guild, and while no event is mandatory, we do encourage everyone to attend the events they feel that they would enjoy. Showing up to an event never
 obligates participation. Coming to the PvP tournaments just to watch gives our PvPers an audience to show off to! Coming to grinds just to PvP others out
 of the spot is appreciated by the PvE members just trying to farm!
