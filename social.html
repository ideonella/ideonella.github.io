<h1>Socialization</h1>
<p>A big part of the guild is having guildmates to interact with! Between special events,
 guild missions, or ad-hoc parties, there's almost always a group of us doing something together.
 The easiest way to socialize is through Discord.
 Having a microphone on in Discord is completely optional though, so don't worry about pressure to be active in voice.
 Feel free to just listen and respond in guild/party chat!</p>

<p>Our guild has some fairly diverse members, so remember to respect everyone! Review the <a href="/#rules">rules and punishments for breaking them</a>
 if you feel like being prejudice against peoples. Keeping all communication respectful is a critical part of the guild.</p>
